           Constrained Join Proxy for Bootstrapping Protocols
               draft-ietf-anima-constrained-join-proxy-03

Abstract

   This document defines a protocol to securely assign a Pledge to a
   domain, represented by a Registrar, using an intermediary node
   between Pledge and Registrar.  This intermediary node is known as a
   "constrained Join Proxy".

   This document extends the work of [RFC8995] by replacing the Circuit-
   proxy between Pledge and Registrar by a stateless/stateful
   constrained (CoAP) Join Proxy.  It relays join traffic from the
   Pledge to the Registrar.

Internet-Draft                 Join-Proxy                    August 2021


1.  Introduction

   Enrolment of new nodes into networks with enrolled nodes present is
   described in [RFC8995] ("BRSKI") and makes use of Enrolment over
   Secure Transport (EST) [RFC7030] with [RFC8366] vouchers to securely
   enroll devices.  BRSKI connects a new joining device (called Pledge)
   to "Registrars" via a Join Proxy.

   The specified solutions use https and may be too large in terms of
   code space or bandwidth required for constrained devices.
   Constrained devices possibly part of constrained networks [RFC7228]
   typically implement the IPv6 over Low-Power Wireless personal Area
   Networks (6LoWPAN) [RFC4944] and Constrained Application Protocol
   (CoAP) [RFC7252].

   CoAP can be run with the Datagram Transport Layer Security (DTLS)
   [RFC6347] as a security protocol for authenticity and confidentiality
   of the messages.  This is known as the "coaps" scheme.  A constrained
   version of EST, using Coap and DTLS, is described in
   [I-D.ietf-ace-coap-est].  The [I-D.ietf-anima-constrained-voucher]
   extends [I-D.ietf-ace-coap-est] with BRSKI artefacts such as voucher,
   request voucher, and the protocol extensions for constrained Pledges.

   DTLS is a client-server protocol relying on the underlying IP layer
   to perform the routing between the DTLS Client and the DTLS Server.
   However, the new Pledge will not be IP routable until it is
   authenticated to the network.  A new Pledge can only initially use a
   link-local IPv6 address to communicate with a neighbour on the same
   link [RFC6775] until it receives the necessary network configuration
   parameters.  However, before the Pledge can receive these
   configuration parameters, it needs to authenticate itself to the
   network to which it connects.

   During enrollment, a DTLS connection is required between Pledge and
   Registrar.

   This document specifies a new form of Join Proxy and protocol to act
   as intermediary between Pledge and Registrar to relay DTLS messages
   between Pledge and Registrar.  Two versions of the Join Proxy are
   specified:

   1 A stateful Join Proxy that locally stores IP addresses
     during the connection.
   2 A stateless Join Proxy that where the connection state
    is stored in the messages.

   This document is very much inspired by text published earlier in
   [I-D.kumar-dice-dtls-relay].

Internet-Draft                 Join-Proxy                    August 2021


   [I-D.richardson-anima-state-for-joinrouter] outlined the various
   options for building a join proxy.  [RFC8995] adopted only the
   Circuit Proxy method (1), leaving the other methods as future work.
   This document standardizes the CoAP/DTLS (method 4).

2.  Terminology

   The following terms are defined in [RFC8366], and are used
   identically as in that document: artifact, imprint, domain, Join
   Registrar/Coordinator (JRC), Manufacturer Authorized Signing
   Authority (MASA), Pledge, Trust of First Use (TOFU), and Voucher.

   The term "installation network" refers to all devices in the
   installation and the network connections between them.  The term
   "installation IP_address" refers to the set of adresses which are
   routable over the whole installation network.

3.  Requirements Language

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
   BCP 14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

4.  Join Proxy functionality

   As depicted in the Figure 1, the Pledge (P), in an LLN mesh can be
   more than one hop away from the Registrar (R) and not yet
   authenticated into the network.

   In this situation, the Pledge can only communicate one-hop to its
   nearest neighbour, the Join Proxy (J) using their link-local IPv6
   addresses.  However, the Pledge (P) needs to communicate with end-to-
   end security with a Registrar to authenticate and get the relevant
   system/network parameters.  If the Pledge (P), knowing the IP-address
   of the Registrar, initiates a DTLS connection to the Registrar, then
   the packets are dropped at the Join Proxy (J) since the Pledge (P) is
   not yet admitted to the network or there is no IP routability to
   Pledge (P) for any returned messages from the Registrar.

                      Figure 1: multi-hop enrolment.

   Without routing the Pledge (P) cannot establish a secure connection
   to the Registrar (R) over multiple hops in the network.

   Furthermore, the Pledge (P) cannot discover the IP address of the
   Registrar (R) over multiple hops to initiate a DTLS connection and
   perform authentication.

   To overcome the problems with non-routability of DTLS packets and/or
   discovery of the destination address of the Registrar, the Join Proxy
   is introduced.  This Join Proxy functionality is configured into all
   authenticated devices in the network which may act as a Join Proxy
   for Pledges.  The Join Proxy allows for routing of the packets from
   the Pledge using IP routing to the intended Registrar.  An
   authenticated Join Proxy can discover the routable IP address of the
   Registrar over multiple hops.  The following Section 5 specifies the
   two Join Proxy modes.  A comparison is presented in Section 6.

5.  Join Proxy specification

   A Join Proxy can operate in two modes:

   o  Statefull mode

   o  Stateless mode

   A Join Proxy MUST implement one of the two modes.  A Join Proxy MAY
   implement both, with an unspecified mechanism to switch between the
   two modes.

5.1.  Statefull Join Proxy

   In stateful mode, the Join Proxy forwards the DTLS messages to the
   Registrar.

   Assume that the Pledge does not know the IP address of the Registrar
   it needs to contact.  The Join Proxy has has been enrolled via the
   Registrar and learns the IP address and port of the Registrar, for

   example by using the discovery mechanism described in Section 7.  The
   Pledge first discovers (see Section 7) and selects the most
   appropriate Join Proxy.  (Discovery can also be based upon [RFC8995]
   section 4.1, or via DNS-SD service discovery [RFC6763]).  The Pledge
   initiates its request as if the Join Proxy is the intended Registrar.
   The Join Proxy receives the message at a discoverable "Join" port.
   The Join Proxy constructs an IP packet by copying the DTLS payload
   from the message received from the Pledge, and provides source and
   destination addresses to forward the message to the intended
   Registrar.  The Join Proxy maintains a 4-tuple array to translate the
   DTLS messages received from the Registrar and forward it back to the
   Pledge.

   In Figure 2 the various steps of the message flow are shown, with
   5684 being the standard coaps port:

5.2.  Stateless Join Proxy

   The stateless Join Proxy aims to minimize the requirements on the
   constrained Join Proxy device.  Stateless operation requires no
   memory in the Join Proxy device, but may also reduce the CPU impact
   as the device does not need to search through a state table.

   If an untrusted Pledge that can only use link-local addressing wants
   to contact a trusted Registrar, and the Registrar is more than one
   hop away, it sends its DTLS messages to the Join Proxy.

   When a Pledge attempts a DTLS connection to the Join Proxy, it uses
   its link-local IP address as its IP source address.  This message is
   transmitted one-hop to a neighbouring (Join Proxy) node.  Under
   normal circumstances, this message would be dropped at the neighbour
   node since the Pledge is not yet IP routable or is not yet
   authenticated to send messages through the network.  However, if the
   neighbour device has the Join Proxy functionality enabled, it routes
   the DTLS message to its Registrar of choice.

   The Join Proxy sends a "new" JPY message which includes the DTLS data
   as payload.

   The JPY message payload consists of two parts:

   o  Header (H) field: consisting of the source link-local address and
      port of the Pledge (P), and

   o  Contents (C) field: containing the original DTLS payload.

   On receiving the JPY message, the Registrar (or proxy) retrieves the
   two parts.

   The Registrar transiently stores the Header field information.  The
   Registrar uses the Contents field to execute the Registrar
   functionality.  However, when the Registrar replies, it also extends
   its DTLS message with the header field in a JPY message and sends it
   back to the Join Proxy.  The Registrar SHOULD NOT assume that it can
   decode the Header Field, it should simply repeat it when responding.
   The Header contains the original source link-local address and port
   of the Pledge from the transient state stored earlier and the
   Contents field contains the DTLS payload.

   On receiving the JPY message, the Join Proxy retrieves the two parts.
   It uses the Header field to route the DTLS message containing the
   DTLS payload retrieved from the Contents field to the Pledge.

   In this scenario, both the Registrar and the Join Proxy use
   discoverable "Join" ports, which may be the default ports.

       for the physical port as cbor integer.  The header field is not
       DTLS encrypted.

   2.  Content field: containing the DTLS payload as a CBOR byte string.

   The join_proxy cannot decrypt the DTLS payload and has no knowledge
   of the transported media type.

       JPY_message =
       [
          ip      : bstr,
          port    : int,
          family  : int,
          index   : int
          payload : bstr
       ]


               Figure 4: CDDL representation of JPY message

   The content fields are DTLS encrypted.  In CBOR diagnostic notation
   the payload JPY[H(IP_P:p_P)], will look like:

         [h'IP_p', p_P, family, ident, h'DTLS-payload']

   Examples are shown in Appendix A.

6.  Comparison of stateless and statefull modes

   The stateful and stateless mode of operation for the Join Proxy have
   their advantages and disadvantages.  This section should enable to
   make a choice between the two modes based on the available device
   resources and network bandwidth.

7.  Discovery

   It is assumed that Join Proxy seamlessly provides a coaps connection
   between Pledge and Registrar.  In particular this section replaces
   section 4.1 of [RFC8995].

   The discovery follows two steps with two alternatives for step 1:

   1.  Two alternatives:

   a.  The Pledge is one hop away from the Registrar.  The Pledge
   discovers the link-local address of the Registrar as described in
   [I-D.ietf-ace-coap-est].  From then on, it follows the BRSKI process
   as described in [I-D.ietf-ace-coap-est] and
   [I-D.ietf-anima-constrained-voucher], using link-local addresses.

Internet-Draft                 Join-Proxy                    August 2021


   b.  The Pledge is more than one hop away from a relevant Registrar,
   and discovers the link-local address and join port of a Join Proxy.
   The Pledge then follows the BRSKI procedure using the link-local
   address of the Join Proxy.

   1.  Once enrolled, the Join Proxy discovers the join port of the
       Registrar.

   Once a Pledge is enrolled, it may function as Join Proxy.  The Join
   Proxy functions are advertised as descibed below.  In principle, the
   Join Proxy functions are offered via a "join" port, and not the
   standard coaps port.  Also the Registrar offers a "join" port to
   which the stateless join proxy sends the JPY message.  The Join Proxy
   and Registrar show the extra join port number when reponding to a
   /.well-known/core discovery request addressed to the standard coap/
   coaps port.

   Three discovery cases are discussed: Join_proxy discovers Registrar,
   Pledge discovers Registrar, and Pledge discovers Join-proxy.  Each
   discovery case considers threa alternatives: coap discovery, 6tisch
   discovery and GRASP discovery.

7.1.  Join-Proxy discovers Registrar

   In this section, the Pledge and Join Proxy are assumed to communicate
   via Link-Local addresses.  This section describes the discovery of
   the Registrar by the Join-Proxy.

7.1.1.  CoAP discovery

   The discovery of the coaps Registrar, using coap discovery, by the
   Join Proxy follows section 6 of [I-D.ietf-ace-coap-est].

7.1.2.  Autonomous Network

   In the context of autonomous networks, the Join Proxy uses the DULL
   GRASP M_FLOOD mechanism to announce itself.  Section 4.1.1 of
   [RFC8995] discusses this in more detail.  The Registrar announces
   itself using ACP instance of GRASP using M_FLOOD messages.
   Autonomous Network Join Proxies MUST support GRASP discovery of
   Registrar as decribed in section 4.3 of [RFC8995] .

7.1.3.  6tisch discovery

   The discovery of Registrar by the Join-Proxy uses the enhanced
   beacons as discussed in [I-D.ietf-6tisch-enrollment-enhanced-beacon].

Internet-Draft                 Join-Proxy                    August 2021


7.2.  Pledge discovers Join Proxy

7.2.1.  Autonomous Network

   The Pledge MUST listen for GRASP M_FLOOD [I-D.ietf-anima-grasp]
   announcements of the objective: "AN_Proxy".  See section
   Section 4.1.1 [RFC8995] for the details of the objective.

7.2.2.  CoAP discovery

   In the context of a coap network without Autonomous Network support,
   discovery follows the standard coap policy.  The Pledge can discover
   a Join Proxy by sending a link-local multicast message to ALL CoAP
   Nodes with address FF02::FD.  Multiple or no nodes may respond.  The
   handling of multiple responses and the absence of responses follow
   section 4 of [RFC8995].

   The join port of the Join Proxy is discovered by sending a GET
   request to "/.well-known/core" including a resource type (rt)
   parameter with the value "brski-proxy" [RFC6690].  Upon success, the
   return payload will contain the join port.

   The example below shows the discovery of the join port of the Join
   Proxy.

     REQ: GET coap://[FF02::FD]/.well-known/core?rt=brski-proxy

     RES: 2.05 Content
     <coaps://[IP_address]:join-port>; rt="brski-proxy"

   Port numbers are assumed to be the default numbers 5683 and 5684 for
   coap and coaps respectively (sections 12.6 and 12.7 of [RFC7252] when
   not shown in the response.  Discoverable port numbers are usually
   returned for Join Proxy resources in the <href> of the payload (see
   section 5.1 of [I-D.ietf-ace-coap-est]).

7.2.3.  6tisch discovery

   Not applicable.

7.3.  Join Proxy discovers Registrar join port

7.3.1.  CoAP discovery

   The stateless Join Proxy can discover the join port of the Registrar
   by sending a GET request to "/.well-known/core" including a resource
   type (rt) parameter with the value "join-proxy" [RFC6690].  Upon

Internet-Draft                 Join-Proxy                    August 2021


   success, the return payload will contain the join Port of the
   Registrar.

     REQ: GET coap://[IP_address]/.well-known/core?rt=join-proxy

     RES: 2.05 Content
     <coaps://[IP_address]:join-port>; rt="join-proxy"

   The discoverable port numbers are usually returned for Join Proxy
   resources in the <href> of the payload (see section 5.1 of
   [I-D.ietf-ace-coap-est]).

8.  Security Considerations

   It should be noted here that the contents of the CBOR map used to
   convey return address information is not protected.  However, the
   communication is between the Proxy and a known registrar are over the
   already secured portion of the network, so are not visible to
   eavesdropping systems.

   All of the concerns in [RFC8995] section 4.1 apply.  The Pledge can
   be deceived by malicious Join_Proxy announcements.  The Pledge will
   only join a network to which it receives a valid [RFC8366] voucher
   [I-D.ietf-anima-constrained-voucher].

   If the communicatione between Join-Proxy and Registrar passed over an
   unsecure network, then an attacker could change the cbor array,
   causing the Pledge to send traffic to another node.  If the such
   scenario needed to be supported, then it would be reasonable for the
   Proxy to encrypt the CBOR array using a locally generated symmetric
   key.  The Registrar would not be able to examine the result, but it
   does not need to do so.  This is a topic for future work.

9.  IANA Considerations

   This document needs to create a registry for key indices in the CBOR
   map.  It should be given a name, and the amending formula should be
   IETF Specification.

9.1.  Resource Type registry

   This specification registers a new Resource Type (rt=) Link Target
   Attributes in the "Resource Type (rt=) Link Target Attribute Values"
   subregistry under the "Constrained RESTful Environments (CoRE)
   Parameters" registry.
